# super_rogue_soccer

## Design

1. turn based soccer game
2. party of players
3. receiving a goal ends the run
4. random dungeon generation?
5. some kind of abilities (sci-fi, fantasy?) => cyberpunk
6. good play generates Heat that can be used for moves
7. red cards kill players
8. players have abilities

## ToDo
- Pathfinding should take world into consideration
- bug in preview (show from current player or don't show at all)
- All actions cost ap
- Shot preview
- Team members walk onto field (esc to cancel)
- Trillerpfeife for start
- Heat
- Perks/Abilities
- Encyclopedia
- Random maps
- In debug, skip splashscreen
- Tab for overlay
- Turn infos (PLAYERS TURN / ENEMYS TURN)
